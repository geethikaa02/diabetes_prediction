# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Web App

This project is a **machine learning-powered web application** built using **Streamlit** that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on key medical attributes. It uses a pre-trained model and provides an easy-to-use web interface for quick diagnosis.

## ðŸ§  Model Information

- The model is trained on the [PIMA Diabetes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) (`diabetes.csv`).
- It predicts whether a person is **diabetic (1)** or **not diabetic (0)** using 8 input features:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - BloodPressure
  - SkinThickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
  - Age

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **NumPy**
- **Pickle**
- **Streamlit**

## ðŸ“Œ Sample Input (for Testing in `app.py`)

```python
input_data = (5,166,72,19,175,25.8,0.587,51)
```
